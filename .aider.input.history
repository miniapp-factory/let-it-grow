+Code the following app

+App Concept: Let-it-grow
+Name: Let-it-growCore
+Purpose: A productivity and well-being app that uses the gamified metaphor of growing a virtual garden to track and motivate users in achieving personal goals, completing tasks, and building positive habits.1. Target AudienceThe app is designed for individuals who:Struggle with procrastination and maintaining consistency in daily habits.Are interested in personal growth, habit tracking, and goal setting.Enjoy gamified experiences and visual feedback on their progress.Need a gentle, positive reminder system to stay on track.2. Key FeaturesA. The Virtual Garden (The Core Metaphor)Plant-Based Progress: Every task or habit the user sets is linked to a virtual plant (e.g., a sapling for a long-term goal, a small flower for a daily habit).Watering/Growth Mechanism: When the user successfully checks off a task or habit for the day, their linked plant receives "water" (progress points) and grows slightly.Failure States: If a user misses a habit or fails to log progress, the linked plant visually wilts, but does not permanently die, encouraging them to return and revive it.Visual Rewards: As the user maintains consistency, their garden expands, new decorative items unlock, and their plants mature from seedlings to full-grown flora.B. Habit TrackerDaily, Weekly, and Monthly Cycles: Users can set habits (e.g., "Read for 30 minutes," "Exercise," "Meditate") and assign them specific frequencies.Streak Tracking: Detailed statistics on current and longest streaks to maintain motivation.Goal Linking: Link multiple related habits to a larger "Goal Plant" to show how small actions contribute to the big picture.C. Goal Setter (The Long-Term Crop)Project-based Goals: For larger, multi-step goals (e.g., "Finish Book Draft," "Learn Spanish Basics"), the goal is represented by a large, slow-growing tree.Milestone Breakdown: Users define milestones, and checking off a milestone provides a significant growth boost to the tree.Time Tracking Integration: Optional integration for logging focused work time (e.g., using a Pomodoro timer) that adds progress to the current active goal.D. Customization & AestheticsSeed Shop: Users earn in-app currency (e.g., "Dewdrops") by completing tasks, which they can use to unlock new types of plants, unique terrains, and decorative items for their garden (fences, fountains, garden gnomes).Environmental Themes: Switch the garden setting (e.g., from a lush forest to a desert oasis) to keep the environment feeling fresh.3. Technology Stack RecommendationGiven the need for real-time visual updates and persistent user data:Frontend (UI/UX): React or Angular (using a single file structure). The visuals would benefit from a canvas-based rendering library (like basic Canvas API or Three.js for a more sophisticated 3D look) for the garden environment.Database: Google Firestore for real-time synchronization of user progress, garden state, and habit data.API: Gemini API could be integrated to provide motivational messages or offer smart, personalized suggestions for new habits based on user patterns (e.g., "You tend to finish your tasks before 10 AM, try adding a morning meditation habit!").
